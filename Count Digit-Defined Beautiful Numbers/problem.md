## Description

You are given two integers l and r, representing a range of positive integers.

A number x is called beautiful if:

- Let S be the sum of its digits.
- Let P be the product of its digits.
- The number is beautiful if P is divisible by S, i.e., P % S == 0.

Your task is to count how many numbers in the interval [l, r] satisfy this condition.
