## Description

You are given an integer n.

A number is considered a mirror number if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left.

A number is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Your task is to find the smallest integer x such that x is greater than or equal to n, x is prime, and x is a mirror number.

It is guaranteed that a valid answer exists within the range from 2 to 2 × 10⁸.
