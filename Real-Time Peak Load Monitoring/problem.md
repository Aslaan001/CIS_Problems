## Description

A real-time analytics system monitors workload values generated by servers over time.  
These values are stored in an integer array `nums`, where each element represents the load recorded at a specific time unit.

To analyze short-term performance spikes, the system uses a fixed-size observation window of length `k`.  
This window starts at the beginning of the array and moves one position to the right at each step until it reaches the end.

At any moment, only the values inside the current window are visible.

For every position of the sliding window, your task is to determine the `maximum load value` within that window.

Return a list containing the maximum value for each window position, in the same order as the windows appear.

This operation is critical for detecting peak loads efficiently without reprocessing the entire dataset for each window shift.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

8  
1 3 -1 -3 5 3 6 7  
3

#### Output

3 3 5 5 6 7

#### Explanation

The window positions and their maximum values are:

- [1, 3, -1] → 3  
- [3, -1, -3] → 3  
- [-1, -3, 5] → 5  
- [-3, 5, 3] → 5  
- [5, 3, 6] → 6  
- [3, 6, 7] → 7  

### 2

#### Input

1  
1  
1

#### Output

1

#### Explanation

There is only one window containing a single element, so the maximum value is the element itself.

## Input Format

- First line contains an integer n, the number of elements in the array.
- Second line contains n space-separated integers representing the array nums.
- Third line contains an integer k representing the window size.

## Output Format

- Return a sequence of integers representing the maximum value in each sliding window.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000  
- -10000 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10000  
- 1 ≤ k ≤ n
