## Description

A cybersecurity operations team is reviewing encrypted communication logs generated by internal services within a distributed system.  
Each log is represented as a string containing only three specific signal markers:

- `a` indicates an authentication event  
- `b` indicates an authorization event  
- `c` indicates a confirmation event  

For a communication segment to be considered secure and valid, it must include at least one occurrence of all three signal markers.

You are given a string `s` that represents a continuous stream of these communication signals over time.

Your task is to determine how many contiguous communication windows (substrings) exist such that each window contains at least one `a`, one `b`, and one `c`.

Return the total count of such valid communication windows.

This metric helps the team assess how frequently complete security handshakes occur within the system.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

abcabc

#### Output

10

#### Explanation

The valid communication windows are:

- abc  
- abca  
- abcab  
- abcabc  
- bca  
- bcab  
- bcabc  
- cab  
- cabc  
- abc  

Each of these substrings contains all three required signal markers.

### 2

#### Input

aaacb

#### Output

3

#### Explanation

The valid communication windows are:

- aaacb  
- aacb  
- acb  

### 3

#### Input

abc

#### Output

1

#### Explanation

Only one contiguous window exists, and it contains all required signals.

## Input Format

- A single string `s` representing the communication signal stream  
- The string consists only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`

## Output Format

- Return a single integer — the number of valid communication windows

## Constraints

- 3 ≤ length of `s` ≤ 5 × 10⁴  
- `s[i]` ∈ { `a`, `b`, `c` }

## Time Limit
