## Description

A backend service processes a collection of textual identifiers generated by multiple subsystems.  
Each identifier is represented as a lowercase string.

For consistency checks and routing optimization, the system needs to determine the `longest common prefix` shared across all identifiers in a given batch.

The longest common prefix is defined as the longest string that appears at the `beginning of every identifier` in the list.

If no such prefix exists, the system should return an empty string.

Your task is to compute this longest shared prefix among the given list of strings.

This operation is commonly used in indexing, autocomplete systems, and grouped identifier validation.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input

3  
flower  
flow  
flight

#### Output

fl

#### Explanation

All strings start with the prefix `fl`, and no longer common prefix exists.

### 2

#### Input

3  
dog  
dracecar  
dcar

#### Output

d

#### Explanation

There is no common starting prefix shared by all strings.

## Input Format

- First line contains an integer n, the number of strings.
- The next n lines each contain a string.

## Output Format

- Return a single string representing the longest common prefix.
- If no common prefix exists, return an empty string.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 200  
- 0 ≤ length of each string ≤ 200  
- Each string contains only lowercase English letters if non-empty
