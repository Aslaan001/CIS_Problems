## Description

A data processing system works with large textual sequences generated by repeating smaller base patterns multiple times. These sequences are often compared to determine how many times a smaller pattern-based sequence can be derived from a larger one under relaxed matching rules.

You are given two base strings `s1` and `s2`, along with two integers `n1` and `n2`.

Define:
- `str1` as the string formed by concatenating `s1` exactly `n1` times.
- `str2` as the string formed by concatenating `s2` exactly `n2` times.

A string `a` is said to be obtainable from another string `b` if `a` can be formed by deleting zero or more characters from `b` without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

Your task is to determine the maximum integer `m` such that the string formed by repeating `str2` exactly `m` times can be obtained from `str1`.

In other words, find the largest `m` for which `[s2, n2 × m]` can be extracted as a subsequence from `[s1, n1]`.

Return this maximum value of `m`.

## Examples

### 1

#### Input
acb  
4  
ab  
2  

#### Output
2

#### Explanation

The string formed by repeating `"acb"` four times can produce the string `"ab"` repeated four times. Since `"ab"` repeated twice equals `"abab"`, the maximum valid value of `m` is 2.

### 2

#### Input
acb  
1  
acb  
1  

#### Output
1

#### Explanation

The two generated strings are identical, so the maximum possible value of `m` is 1.

## Input Format

- First line: string `s1`
- Second line: integer `n1`
- Third line: string `s2`
- Fourth line: integer `n2`

## Output Format

- Return a single integer representing the maximum value of `m`

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ length of `s1`, `s2` ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ n1, n2 ≤ 1000000
- `s1` and `s2` consist only of lowercase English letters
